<h1>Flickering in kodi when using volume buttons</h1>
<p>I experienced this weird behavour in kodi after a fresh setup where movies played fine but as soon as I changed the
volume it flickered because of the appearing volume bar.
The fix is to go to Settings &gt; Player &gt; Videos &gt; Processing &gt; PRIME Render Method &gt; set to EGL</p>
<p>P.s. this was on raspberrypi 3B</p>
