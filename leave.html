<h1>How to use 'leave' on arch Linux</h1>
<p>Recently I discovered a very nice tool on debian-like systems called &quot;leave&quot;.
It's only purpose is to remind you when you have to leave.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
$ date +%H:%M:%S
14:17:29
$ leave +0020
Alarm set for Sat May  2 14:37. (pid 53921)
</pre>
<p>What we did here was setting the leave reminder in 20 Minutes. You also can set a fix time with <pre>$ leave 15:13</pre>
Too bad this tool does not exist in the AUR. But I discovered a simple way to use the debian version.
Just download the deb file. For example the <a href="https://packages.debian.org/buster/amd64/leave/download">64-bit version</a>.
Unpackage it and you'll find the compiled binary in <i>./usr/bin/leave</i>. Just move it to this location and you are ready to use it.</p>
